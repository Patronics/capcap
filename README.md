uses coqui STT to create live captions for the real world.

## Inspiration
Those who are hard of hearing or deaf often struggle to communicate with others, even when they learn to lipread, it's not easy, and often difficult to understand.
## What it does
Caption hat listens to the speech around its wearer, and creates real-time captions of what was said. It can also text you reminders on command.
## How we built it
We used a Raspberry Pi 4, coqui.ai speech recognition, and a 24x2 character lcd.
## Challenges we ran into

## What's next for CaptionHat
Migrating to a more elegant form factor is a priority, probably something more like google glass. Improving the screen's resolution in the process, so we can fit more text on screen at once. 
We also considered adding an accelerometer, and showing an "artificial horizon" view, to assist those with impaired balance in addition to hearing loss, as those are common comorbidities.
